"""Clean 2D one-ball *velocity* dataset with exact ground-truth state (Step 2, velocity-first).

This is the deliberately-minimal controlled dataset the velocity experiments are built on. The design
follows the supervisor's spec to the letter so that the only thing varying between clips is the physics
we want to probe/steer — nothing else:

* **One ball, clean white background.** No second object, no texture, no shading, no gravity by default
  — so a "velocity subspace" can't be confounded with object type, lighting, or scene appearance (the
  exact confound that made the Step-1 *category* directions un-steerable).
* **Constant velocity, object stays fully in frame the whole clip.** The ball never bounces or leaves
  the frame, so every frame is a clean linear-motion sample and the velocity label is constant over the
  clip. Initial position + velocity are sampled so the straight-line trajectory is guaranteed to keep
  the whole disk inside ``[radius, 1-radius]`` for all ``T`` frames (rejection-sampled).
* **32 frames, 128x128, fixed FPS.** Matches the spec; ``fps`` is recorded in meta so every comparison
  is at a fixed frame rate (velocity in *pixels/frame* is only meaningful at fixed FPS).
* **Exact metadata.** Per-frame center position, exact velocity vector, speed, direction angle, radius,
  plus a per-frame ``visible`` flag (used by the occlusion variant). Stored in the same packed
  ``state`` / ``state_keys`` contract as :mod:`synthetic_physics` so all the existing probe/steer/decode
  machinery (``LatentDataset``, ``train_probe``, steering) works unchanged.

Variants (selected by ``scenario``):

* ``constant_velocity`` — the core probe/steer dataset.
* ``scene_velocity`` — the **difference-vector steering** dataset (supervisor's 2026-06-26 proposal).
  Clips are grouped into *scenes*; within a scene there are ``clips_per_scene`` clips that share an
  **identical first frame and motion direction** and differ **only in speed**. This is exactly the
  controlled pair the supervisor wants for latent arithmetic: encode two same-scene clips
  ``H_a = E(v_a)``, ``H_b = E(v_b)`` and ``H_b - H_a`` isolates the *speed* factor (everything else —
  start position, direction, radius, colour, background — is held fixed). Decoding
  ``H_a + alpha*(H_b - H_a)`` while sweeping ``alpha`` should make the ball visibly speed up / slow down
  in pixel space, *on-manifold* (alpha=0 -> v_a, alpha=1 -> v_b), instead of pushing an off-manifold
  probe direction. Scenes are seeded by scene-id so every clip of a scene reproduces the same scene
  parameters; the per-clip ``rank`` (0=slowest .. K-1=fastest) selects the speed.
* ``scene_size`` / ``scene_color`` / ``scene_background`` — **nuisance-control** scene datasets, built
  to the same same-scene-pair contract as ``scene_velocity`` but holding velocity + trajectory FIXED
  across the scene and ramping exactly ONE appearance factor across ranks (ball radius / ball colour /
  flat background shade). ``H_b - H_a`` then isolates that single factor. These are the controls for the
  disentanglement experiment: the "true" velocity axis should lie in the complement of the
  size/colour/background subspaces, so steering velocity leaves size/colour/background untouched.
* ``scene_velocity2d_mixed`` — like ``scene_velocity2d`` (per scene one start, ``K`` distinct velocity
  VECTORs), but the appearance (radius, ball colour, background shade) is sampled ONCE per scene and held
  fixed across its ranks while VARYING across scenes. ``H_b - H_a`` still cancels appearance within a
  scene; the test is whether the global velocity subspace + linear command map (cmd-U8) survive
  heterogeneous appearance across scenes.
* ``scene_restitution`` — **coefficient-of-restitution** scene dataset for bounce steering. Within a
  scene all ranks share identical frame-0 geometry (start position, incoming velocity, radius) and differ
  **only** in wall restitution ``e`` (rank 0 = least bouncy .. K-1 = most). Trajectories are identical
  until the first bottom-wall bounce, then diverge — the same-scene difference ``H_b - H_a`` isolates the
  restitution factor for on-manifold latent arithmetic / command operators.
* ``occlusion`` — a static vertical wall in the middle of the frame; the ball passes *behind* it and is
  invisible for the middle frames. Tests whether velocity is still decodable while the ball is hidden
  (object-permanence / physical-state evidence).
* ``rotated`` — same *speed*, sampled over a full range of *directions* (and an optional global frame
  rotation), for the equivariance experiment: a true velocity subspace should be equivariant under a
  rotation of the velocity (up to a rotation of the subspace).

The renderer is deterministic and dependency-light (anti-aliased disk on white), so the dataset
reproduces bit-for-bit anywhere (cluster, laptop, CI) and the ground truth is exact.
